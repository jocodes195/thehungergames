                    Could you survive on your own in the wild, with every one out to make sure you don't live to see the
                    morning?<br><br>
                    In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol
                    surrounded
                    by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by
                    forcing
                    them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the
                    annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.<br><br>

                    Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as
                    a
                    death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been
                    close
                    to dead before—and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a
                    contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weight survival against
                    humanity and life against love.

                    Sparks are igniting.<br>
                    Flames are spreading.<br>
                    And the Capitol wants revenge.<br><br>

                    Against all odds, Katniss Everdeen has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute
                    Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she
                    has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it
                    to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are
                    whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol—a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped
                    create.<br><br>

                    Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest that she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares
                    her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss
                    and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than
                    ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each
                    other, the consequences will be horrifying.<br><br>

                    In Catching Fire, the second novel of the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story
                    of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before . . . and surprising readers at every turn.

                    My name is Katniss Everdeen.<br>
                    Why am I not dead?<br>
                    I should be dead.<br><br>

                    Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has
                    escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does
                    exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.<br><br>

                    It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and
                    it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has
                    come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand
                    in the carefully laid plans—except Katniss.<br><br>

                    The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility
                    for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside
                    her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay—no matter what the
                    personal cost.

                    It is the morning of the reaping that will kick off the tenth annual Hunger Games. In the Capital,
                    eighteen-year-old Coriolanus Snow is preparing for his one shot at glory as a mentor in the Games.
                    The once-mighty house of Snow has fallen on hard times, its fate hanging on the slender chance that
                    Coriolanus will be able to outcharm, outwit, and outmaneuver his fellow students to mentor the
                    winning tribute.<br><br>

                    The odds are against him. He's been given the humiliating assignment of mentoring the female tribute
                    from District 12, the lowest of the low. Their fates are now completely intertwined -- every choice
                    Coriolanus makes could lead to favor or failure, triumph or ruin. Inside the arena, it will be a
                    fight to the death. Outside the arena, Coriolanus starts to feel for his doomed tribute... and must
                    weigh his need to follow the rules against his desire to survive no matter what it takes.
